        I am a passionate frontend developer who loves to experiment and build
        features for all kinds of web applications. Since my high school days,
        I've always had an interest in coding and computers. My interest helped
        me go from building single-page websites to more complex systems. I am
        able to easily adapt to the documentation, standards and best practices
        of the frameworks I am asked to work with. I else enjoy trying out new
        things and learning from them. I can empathize with the users, and I
        understand how important it is to make sure the complex systems that I
        build are usable by them. Furthermore, I believe that usability is key
        in the final product. Currently, I am looking for opportunities to work
        for a company that promotes development and stability. A place where I
        can fully utilize my experience, learn and grow
        professionally.</v-list-item
